# Unit testing

The correctness of new implementations can be verified via running unit tests. Below are the information on how to run unit tests.

## Running
To run the unit tests, first build Clio as normal, then execute `./clio_tests` to run all unit tests.

# Adding Unit Tests
To add unit tests, please create a separate file for the component you are trying to cover (unless it already exists) and use any other existing unit test file as an example.
