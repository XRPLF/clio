Clio is an XRP Ledger API server optimized for RPC calls over WebSocket or JSON-RPC.
It stores validated historical ledger and transaction data in a more space efficient format, and uses up to 4 times less space than [rippled](https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled).

Clio can be configured to store data in [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html) or [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/), enabling scalable read throughput.
Multiple Clio nodes can share access to the same dataset, which allows for a highly available cluster of Clio nodes without the need for redundant data storage or computation.

## ðŸ“¡ Clio and `rippled`

Clio offers the full `rippled` API, with the caveat that Clio by default only returns validated data. This means that `ledger_index` defaults to `validated` instead of `current` for all requests. Other non-validated data, such as information about queued transactions, is also not returned.

Clio retrieves data from a designated group of `rippled` nodes instead of connecting to the peer-to-peer network.
For requests that require access to the peer-to-peer network, such as `fee` or `submit`, Clio automatically forwards the request to a `rippled` node and propagates the response back to the client. To access non-validated data for *any* request, simply add `ledger_index: "current"` to the request, and Clio will forward the request to `rippled`.

> [!NOTE]  
> Clio requires access to at least one `rippled` node, which can run on the same machine as Clio or separately.
